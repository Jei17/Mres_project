	Abstract = {AbstractClimate models project that heavy precipitation events intensify with climate change. It is generally accepted that extreme day‐long events will increase at a rate of about 6--7\% per degree warming, consistent with the Clausius‐Clapeyron relation. However, recent studies suggest that subdaily (e.g., hourly) precipitation extremes may increase at about twice this rate. Conventional climate models are not suited to assess such events, due to the limited spatial resolution and the need to parametrize convective precipitation (i.e., thunderstorms and rain showers). Here we employ a convection‐resolving model using a horizontal grid spacing of 2.2 km across an extended region covering the Alps and its larger‐scale surrounding from northern Italy to northern Germany. Consistent with previous results, projections using a Representative Concentration Pathways version 8.5 greenhouse gas scenario reveal a significant decrease of mean summer precipitation. However, unlike previous studies, we find that both extreme day‐long and hour‐long precipitation events asymptotically intensify with the Clausius‐Clapeyron relation. Differences to previous studies might be due to the model or region considered, but we also show that it is inconsistent to extrapolate from present‐day precipitation scaling into the future.},

	Abstract = {Current changes in tropical precipitation from satellite data and climate models are assessed. Wet and dry regions of the tropics are defined as the highest 30% and lowest 70% of monthly precipitation values. Observed tropical ocean trends in the wet regime (1.8%/decade) and the dry regions (−2.6%/decade) according to the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) over the period including Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) data (1988--2008), where GPCP is believed to be more reliable, are of smaller magnitude than when including the entire time series (1979--2008) and closer to model simulations than previous comparisons. Analysing changes in extreme precipitation using daily data within the wet regions, an increase in the frequency of the heaviest 6% of events with warming for the SSM/I observations and model ensemble mean is identified. The SSM/I data indicate an increased frequency of the heaviest events with warming, several times larger than the expected Clausius--Clapeyron scaling and at the upper limit of the substantial range in responses in the model simulations.},

@article{AbdulRauf2014,
	Abstract = {The analysis of joint probability distributions of rainfall characteristics such as severity and duration is important in water resources management. Deriving their distributions using standard statistical techniques are often problematical due to its complexity. Standard methods usually assume that the rainfall characteristics are independent or that their marginal distributions belong to the same family of distributions. The use of copulas based methodologies can circumvent these restrictions and are therefore increasingly popular. However, the copulas and marginal distributions that are commonly used belong to specific parametric families and their adoption could lead to spurious inferences if the underlying assumptions are violated. For this reason, we recommend a nonparametric or semiparametric approach to estimate the joint distribution of rainfall characteristics. In this paper, we introduce and compare several copula--based approaches, each involving a combination of parametric or nonparametric marginal distributions conjoined by a parametric or nonparametric copula. An empirical illustration of the different approaches using rainfall data collected from six stations in the state of Victoria, Australia, demonstrated that a nonparametric approach can often give better results than a purely parametric approach.},
